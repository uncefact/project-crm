UNTP depends on trust anchors to add digital integrity to sustainability claims and identities by linking them to the authority, or other recognized entity, under which these credentials were issued. In essence, UNTP defines a protocol for existing trust anchors to continue doing what they have always done, but in a digitally verifiable way.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"register/index":{"id":"register/index","title":"Implementers","description":"This section of the site describes the various types of UNTP-CRM implementers, their roles and function.

Dashboards and scorecards that measure key performance indicators will energise ongoing action and provide valuable feedback at both community and national level. Therefore the AATP defines a minimal set of KPIs that each implementer can easily measure and report to their community - and which communities can report to national entities.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"specification/Architecture":{"id":"specification/Architecture","title":"Architecture","description":"The architecture is the blueprint for all the components of the specification and how they work together.
